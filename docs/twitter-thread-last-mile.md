## Tweet 1 - Hook

I've been thinking about why AI hasn't delivered for small business the way everyone promised.

ChatGPT can write a blog post. It can't pull your overdue invoices and tell you which clients also have meetings booked this week.

I think I know what's missing.

## Tweet 2 - The Metaphor

In logistics, the 'last mile' is the most expensive part of delivery. Getting the package from the warehouse to YOUR door.

AI has the same problem.

The last mile of work = connecting AI to YOUR systems. YOUR spreadsheets. YOUR actual messy business.

---

## Tweet 3 - The Problem

The AI model isn't the bottleneck anymore. The connection is.

Right now, wiring up your QuickBooks to your calendar to your AI costs $150/hour. You need a developer. Most small businesses will never do this.

That's the gap. That's where the 5X productivity is hiding.

## Tweet 4 - The Reframe

Think outside the app.

Stop waiting for the perfect AI tool to show up in the app store. The value isn't in the model. It's in the wiring between the model and the messy reality of your actual business.

You don't need smarter AI. You need AI that can see your spreadsheets.

## Tweet 5 - The Solution

What if you could open a program - like Word, but for solving problems - that already knew how to talk to the tools your industry uses?

A fabricator gets connections to their ERP, quote system, supplier catalogs. A lumber mill gets inventory and compliance. Built in. No setup.

---

## Tweet 6 - How It Works

You describe a problem: "Wouldn't it be great if I could see all my overdue quotes and which overlap with my busiest weeks?"

The AI already has permission to look. It pulls the data. Builds the report. Asks you when it gets stuck - not some support ticket black hole.

Done.

## Tweet 7 - Technical (Accessible)

The tech: MCP (Model Context Protocol) lets AI connect to your tools through 'servers' - think of them as translators.

Instead of building one translator per user, you build one per industry. 50 fabricators share the same connection to the tools they all use. That's the leverage.

---

## Tweet 8 - The Math That Matters

Everyone talks about 10X developers. That's real. But it doesn't scale to the economy.

Get 50% of the population 10% better. Every year. That's your generational growth.

"How do I save 5 hours a week?" "How do I save $700 a month?"

Those are the real questions.

---

## Tweet 9 - The Ripple Effect

Every efficiency gained by a fabricator, mill, or contractor ripples outward.

Faster quotes = more bids submitted. Better inventory = less waste. Automated compliance = fewer missed opportunities.

This isn't replacing workers with AI. It's operational leverage for the people doing the actual work.

---

## Tweet 10 - The Vision

The last mile is where the real work lives.

AI can write your marketing emails. It can explain quantum physics. But it can't solve your actual problems until it can see your actual business.

We need to build the wiring.

---

## Tweet 11 - Brief Product Mention

That's what I'm building with a project called WorkspaceAlberta - custom workspaces for Steel, Lumber, Aluminum with government contract intelligence built in.

But the concept is bigger than one project. Every industry needs its own last-mile solution.

---

## Tweet 12 - Closing

50% of people. 10% better. Every year.

No new app. No new login. No new system to learn. Just AI that can finally see your business.

That's the last mile of work.
