## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Verify Your API Keys

Your workspace needs API keys to connect to your business tools. Check the terminal output above to see which keys are configured.

**To add missing keys:**

2. Go to "Codespaces" > "Secrets"
3. Add the required secrets for your tools

### Step 2: Open the AI Assistant

The AI assistant (Claude) can help you:
- Analyze your business data
- Create automations
- Build reports and dashboards
- Connect your tools together

### Step 3: Describe Your Problem

Start by telling the AI assistant about the business problem you want to solve. Be specific about:
- What's frustrating you
- What information you need
- What outcome you want

**Example:**
> "I need to see which customers haven't been contacted in 30 days, pulling from my Google Contacts and comparing against my recent Stripe transactions."
