# The Problem You Wish You Could Finally Solve

---

## Your Problem:

I wish AI could look at our pipeline and tell me which deals are at risk of going cold, then automatically schedule follow-ups for leads we haven't contacted in over a week.

We have 60+ deals in HubSpot at any time, and it's impossible to keep track of which ones need attention. Every week we lose momentum on good opportunities just because nobody remembered to follow up.

The data is all there - last contact date, deal value, close date - but pulling it together to make decisions takes too long. By the time we build Monday's pipeline report in the spreadsheet, it's already outdated.

Every month we struggle with deals that went cold because we didn't notice them slipping.

## Tools that might be involved:

- HubSpot (CRM, deals, contacts)
- Google Sheets (pipeline tracking)
- Google Drive (meeting notes, proposals)
- Slack (team alerts)
- Calendly (scheduling calls)
