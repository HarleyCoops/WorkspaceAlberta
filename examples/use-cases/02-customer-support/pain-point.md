# The Problem You Wish You Could Finally Solve

---

## Your Problem:

Every support ticket requires me to manually look up order info in Shopify before I can respond. I wish the AI could see both the ticket and the order history so it could draft a response for me.

Most of our tickets are simple - someone wants to know where their order is, or they need tracking info. But I still have to:
1. Open the ticket in Zendesk
2. Copy their email
3. Search in Shopify
4. Find the right order
5. Get the tracking number
6. Write a response
7. Send it

This takes 5-8 minutes per ticket, and we get 20+ tickets a day. I know 80% of these could be handled automatically if the AI could just see the order data.

## Tools that might be involved:

- Zendesk (support tickets)
- Shopify (orders and customers)
- Stripe (payment issues)
- Google Drive (return policy docs)
- Slack (for escalations)
