# Alberta Use Case Examples

Real-world scenarios showing how WorkspaceAlberta helps small businesses automate workflows with AI.

Each scenario includes:
- **`pain-point.md`** - The business problem (what goes in `monthly-pain-point.md`)
- **`tools.md`** - The tool stack (what goes in `owner-tools-list.md`)
- **Generator command** - How to create the workspace

## Scenarios

| # | Scenario | Business Type | Key Tools |
|---|----------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | [Marketing Content Generation](./01-marketing-content/) | Marketing Agency / Solo Marketer | Mailchimp, Buffer, Google Analytics, Slack |
| 2 | [Customer Support Automation](./02-customer-support/) | E-commerce Store | Shopify, Zendesk, Stripe, Slack |

## How These Examples Work

1. **Read the scenario** - Understand the business context and pain point
2. **Copy the tools list** - Use it as your `owner-tools-list.md`
3. **Copy the pain point** - Use it as your `monthly-pain-point.md`
4. **Run the generator** - Create your MCP workspace config
5. **Open in Cursor** - Start building solutions with connected tools

## What Makes a Good Pain Point?

From the [Claude Use Cases](https://claude.com/resources/use-cases) research:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Time sink | "I spend 4+ hours every week manually copying data between systems" |
| Error prone | "Customer info gets out of sync and we miss follow-ups" |
| Bottleneck | "Only one person knows how to generate reports" |
| Repetitive | "Every new hire requires the same 15 manual steps" |

**Bad examples** (too vague):
- "Make marketing better"
- "Improve customer service"
- "Automate things"

**Good examples** (specific, measurable):
- "I wish AI could draft social posts from our blog content and schedule them across 3 platforms"
- "Every support ticket requires me to manually look up order info in Shopify before I can respond"
