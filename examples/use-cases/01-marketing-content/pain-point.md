# The Problem You Wish You Could Finally Solve

---

## Your Problem:

I wish AI could take a blog post we write and automatically create social media variations for each platform, then help me understand which posts actually drove traffic.

Every week we write 2-3 blog posts for clients, but turning those into social content takes hours. We have to manually rewrite for LinkedIn's professional tone, Twitter's character limits, and Facebook's casual style. Then we copy everything into Buffer, and tracking what actually works means jumping between Google Analytics and spreadsheets.

The problem that keeps coming up is: we spend more time reformatting content than creating it.

## Tools that might be involved:

- Google Drive (where blog drafts live)
- Buffer (scheduling)
- Google Analytics (performance tracking)
- Mailchimp (client reports)
- Slack (team coordination)
