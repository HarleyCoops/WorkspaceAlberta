# The Problem You Wish You Could Finally Solve

---

## Your Problem:

Every new hire requires the same 15 manual steps across 5 different systems. I wish AI could handle the checklist and tell me what's done and what's still pending for each person.

We're growing and hiring 1-2 people per month. Each onboarding takes me 3-4 hours spread across several days. The steps are always the same:
- Send and track offer letter
- Set up payroll
- Create accounts
- Share documents
- Add to communication channels
- Schedule meetings

But I'm juggling it manually, and things fall through the cracks. Last month a new hire didn't get added to Slack until day 3. The month before, someone was missing from the health insurance enrollment because I forgot to check a box in Gusto.

I wish AI could take care of tracking all these steps and alerting me when something's incomplete.
