# Alberta Workforce Workspace

This repository is where we build a **workspace** tailored to your business.

A workspace is a place where we connect the tools you already use to an intelligent assistant so we can create a real solution to a real problem.

Before we build anything, we start with only two things:

1. **A list of the tools and systems your business uses**
2. **A clear description of one problem you wish you could finally solve**

You do **not** need to know anything technical.
You do **not** need to describe steps or workflows.
You do **not** need to tell us how you currently do the work.

This is about the *problem*, not the process.

## 1. List every tool or system you use

Create or edit the file:

**`owner-tools-list.md`**

Write down the names of:

- Any software you use daily or monthly
- Any system you log into
- Any internal or custom tool
- Any place where information lives
- Any tool connected to a recurring business issue

Examples:

```
Google Drive
Gmail
Slack
QuickBooks Online
Stripe
Shopify
Notion
Monday.com
A custom scheduling portal
Excel sheets stored on a server
```

A simple list is perfect.
The goal is to create a complete picture of the systems that might relate to your problem.

## 2. Describe one specific problem you wish you could solve

Create or edit the file:

**`monthly-pain-point.md`**

Here, describe **a single business problem**, in plain language, as if speaking to someone helping you.

### Important:
You are **not** describing:

- The steps you follow today
- Your current workflow
- The tasks involved
- Any technical details
- How things "should" work

### Instead, describe **the problem itself** - the thing you wish you could finally solve.

Use prompts like:

- "I wish I could finally solve..."
- "I wish AI could take care of..."
- "The problem that keeps coming up is..."
- "Every month we struggle with..."

### Examples:

```markdown
I wish I could finally solve the problem of keeping customer follow-ups consistent.
People fall through the cracks and I never have a clear view of who needs attention.

I wish AI could help me solve the problem of always being behind on cash flow visibility.

I wish we could solve the issue of job statuses being scattered across multiple systems
and never up to date.

I wish I could solve the problem of supplier invoices not matching what ends up
recorded in our payment system.
```

**Tools involved (if you know them):**
- Shopify
- QuickBooks
- Slack
- Google Drive

That's all we need.

One problem. Stated clearly. No steps. No explanation of what you do today.

## 3. What happens next

Once you've added:

- `owner-tools-list.md`
- `monthly-pain-point.md`

We will:

1. **Build a personalized workspace** based on the tools you listed
2. **Connect only the systems that matter** to your problem
3. **Use this workspace, together**, to design and build the actual solution

You don't need to architect anything.

Your job is simply to:

1. List your tools
2. Identify one business problem you wish you could finally solve

Everything else - design, integration, automation, and intelligence - happens here in the workspace.
